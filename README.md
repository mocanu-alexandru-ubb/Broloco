# Broloco
An old personal project. It's a game inspired from the old pokemon games. In broloco there are 3 rokemons (monsters) that you can capture and use in combat. There are NPCs that you can battle with or converse with.

The game was made using the Broloco engine. To browse the project you need their engine available for download at https://www.greenfoot.org/download
Or, to simply run the game, get the .jar file from releases.
